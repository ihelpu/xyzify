# XYZify

This is a tool for converting gcode files generated by slic3r (the open source
object slicing tool) for use by XYZ Printings XYZware printing tool.

## Slic3r configuration

XYZware reads the comments in a gcode file, looking for specific information. If it fails
to find that, it won't load the file or printing may fail. So we configure slic3r
to provide that information.

Since this information is in the comments, we use the slic3r "Start G-code"
setting. In my version of slic3r, this is in the logical place: "Printer Settings"
under "Custom G-code".

Add the following to the **start** of that section:

```
; --- MOVE THIS SECTION TO THE TOP AND DELETE THIS LINE ---
; filename = composition.3w
; machine = daVinciF10
; material = abs
; layer_height = [layer_height]
; total_layers = 173
; total_filament = 0.00
; extruder = 1
; --- END SECTION ---
```

The XYZify program finds the initial comment (`--MOVE THIS ...`), removing any comments
and blank lines it finds along the way. The comments - and any actual g-code - between
that line and the last one (`-- END SECTION...`) are output, the lines preceeding this
section that haven't been removed are output, then the rest of the file is output
unchanged.

## Usage

At this point, only the command line version is available. It's very raw, as a
web version is anticipated.

### Console

From terminal - or your favorite command line access - run xyzify with standard
input being a gcode file from a properly configured slic3r, and output going to
another gcode file:

```
$ xyzify < myslic3r.gcode > myxyzified.gcode
```

If you want to get the `.3w` file, simply pipe the results through base64:

```
$ xyzify myslic3r.gcode | base64 > myxyzified.3w
```
